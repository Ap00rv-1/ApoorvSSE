2) after installing winrar extract the rar file given.
3) Find the file Flappy Bird.exe
4) run it and your game will open.

The game I've build is the flappy bird.
I've watched few tutorials to do so.
one was tutorial to the unity software 2022 version from freecodecamp. i had to watch it cause i was only a little familiar with the 2017 version and a lot has been changed since then.
In the game i've used all the assets such as the sprites from the codecamp itself, but the music in the game and sprite of potions is what i created myself.
Addition thing i din in the game other than adding music to is was to add a potions concept...like a player if get the potion will be able to increase his score instantly.
It was really fun to build the game i hope you'll appreciate the efforts.
